# Car Inventory Using React Native

This is a mobile application built using React Native that retrieves car inventory data and allows users to view and filter the data based on the car's year.

## Features

- Retrieves car inventory data
- Stores the data in a Context API state variable for easy access across components
- Sorts the car inventory data in increasing ascending order using the car's year (implemented with JavaScript's in-built sort method which uses the Quick Sort algorithm)
- Displays the sorted data to the user
- Provides a user-friendly input field for filtering the car inventory by year in real-time

## Technologies Used

- React Native: A JavaScript framework for building mobile applications.
- Context API: A built-in state management solution in React for sharing data across components.
- QuickSort: A sorting algorithm used to sort the car inventory data based on the car's year.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/eric-ricky/Car-Inventory.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`
5. Use an emulator or scan the QR code to launch the application on a mobile device.

## Conclusion

In this project, I used React Native, Context API, Quick Sort algorithm, and real-time filtering to build a car inventory management system.
